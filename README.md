## Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that extends React's capabilities to build modern, production-ready web applications. It provides essential features such as:

- **Routing**: Built-in file-based routing for easier navigation.
- **Optimized Rendering**: Support for Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) to enhance performance.
- **Data Fetching**: Seamless integration for fetching data during build time, on the server, or in the browser.
- **Bundling and Compiling**: Automatic optimization of JavaScript and CSS for faster load times.
- **Additional Features**: API routes, image optimization, TypeScript support, and more.

Next.js simplifies the development process, making it easier to deliver fast and scalable web applications.
